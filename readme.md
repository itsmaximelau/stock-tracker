## What have I learned ?

## How does it work ?
This short program is ran in a command-line interface (it should be cross-platform). User has to input stock ticker for which he is interested. Then, the program gets current price, previous close price and price variance and refreshes it every 25 seconds (editable). Data is scraped from Yahoo Finance website.
